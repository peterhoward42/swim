    o  Activity boxes
        *  Implement potentially start to box
        *  Shorten full/dash/self lines now we have size
        *  Implement potentially start from-box
        *  Jump ahead to final pass to finalize boxes in progress at end
        o  Handler for explicit end box should be fairly self evident now
            o  try coding to see what can be DRYed
                o  is mixed up in creator with mutating c and returning
                   new prims structure to add
                    o  clear out and make sure ALL methods (not funcs) mutate c
                        *  code
                        *  build
                        *  regression tests
                        o  change names and comments and format
                        o  regression tests
                    o  resume DRY finish activity box
            o  Can avoid drawing top edges earlier now I think when registering
               start of box?
            o  what if the stop statement comes when there is not an
               active box?
        o  Now check that self interactons get the right boxes even when
           the boxes are stopped and re-started in mid-stream
    o  Lane lines
        o  Rename to lifelines first
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword
    o  Change terminology
        o  Lane -> lifeline
        o  TitleBox -> lifelineheader
    o  Should private types be lower case?
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  may need to rebrand as uml sequence diagram

Actitity Boxes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Scanning state has box in progress boolean (inbox)
o  Triggers to start a box:
    o  When an interaction or self loop originates from X, and X is not
       inbox, then start X box before the interaction line.
    o  When an interaction or self loop arrives at X, and X is not
       inbox, then start X box level with the interaction line.
o  Triggers to finish a box:
    o  Explicit stop
    o  End of diagram
o  Need state for inbox for each lane 
    o  Init before first pass create
    o  Preserved through to later passes to close off any remianing open
    o  Must also track Y coords at which each in box started to support
       drawing box sides at end
