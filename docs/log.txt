*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Find visualisation pathway
    *  rename package umli?

    o  export be separate repo
        *  do it
        *  port umli to consume other 
        *  add proper doc/readme incl x ref
        *  change graphics model contract to having want arrow param when
           adding line, but no field in line struct, and *anticipate* list of
           arrowheads in prims
        *  fatten out export for arrows
        o  fatten out export for multiline labels with justifications
            *  change label to be single string with anchor and just,
               so that renderer doesn't have to think about leading
               and fix uk
            *  put in a visual test for each just
                *  first make square a good size
                *  now make diag depth sensible wrt
                *  add dashed lines to example model
                *  add strings to to example model
            o  satisfy visual test
                o  give creator model, font and sizer attribs, passing in
                   and initialising only font
                o  add graphics model to what passed to create and set
                   creator's attrib there
                   

                o  di font to creator or pass mdl in create method?
        o  repair regression test for image create and maybe diag create?

    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        *  Title Boxes
        o  Title Box Text
            o  Consider what utils need confidence in first
                o  export.PNG() should be generic .png, jpg, and .gif
                   or error otherwise
                o  are visual tests conventient?
                o  upgrade export.PNG and its tests to include justified
                   text labels
            o  Expand out Create() case for title box labels, and tests
    o  Have two spelling for lable/label
    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
