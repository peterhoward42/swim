    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    *  Do lifeline lines
    *  change lifelineTitleBox to use tidemark as top, having advanced 
    *  experiment also with centre justifying interaction line labels
    *  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    *  allboxstates is horrid name
    *  newAllBoxStates got left behind in renaming
    *  Should private types be lower case? bit of muddle
    *  How stimulate go lint and go vet from command line
    *  more module level comments
    *  any potential for make diag package smaller? (no)
    *  add a rectangular border with title box
    *  do as go module
    *  reinstate jpeg to export
    *  all one repo?
    *  first parameter name of Creator.rowOfLabels should not be centre

    o  lifeline title boxes are too fat on canoncial example
        *  make helper class
        *  make skel tests
        o  try in the wild 
            *  deprive sizer access to existing Lifelines type
            o  get to work using new class
                *  give creator one,
                    *  shift to being in diag package
                o  work through compiler demands
                    o  move vertical bits of sizer.lifelines into 
                       diag.lifelines
                    o  make sure have used new spacing method for left and right
                       rather than 0.5 based calcs
                    o  names like this in sizer: TitleBoxHeight, should
                       be prefixed with lifeline
                    o  add Length() unit test on segment
                    o  give sizer attribs currently in lifelines like:
                        o  TitleBoxWidth
                    o  put methods like InteractionLineEndPoints into an
                       interaction class
                    o  move vertical sizing into main sizer
                    o  review names of lifeline types across sizer and diag
                    o  update module /type doc strings
        o  once old Lifeline type no longer used - ditch it and Inddividual
           lifelines type
        o  LifelineSpacing should be unexported
        o  LifelineSpacing should be renamed LifelineHorizGeom
        o  go back to do proper tests
        o  commit/push

    o  combine sizer and settings
    o  move package docco into go.doc files
    o  take away choice of font size?
    o  make title compulsory
    o  show lane letters - possibly optionally
    o  consider if image regression tests needed - or maybe only canonical?
    o  what happens if you introduce a lifeline late in the script?
    o  what happens if you put title in too late?
    o  question merit of sizer unit test given visual test efficiency
    o  many lifelines example suggests self labels might be better off
       going back above the loop and being allowed to go further right
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  virgin clone of umli fails create tests because no directory
       to save in - fix when decide on visual image difference testing
    o  Lifeline should be different mark space than response line
    o  Convenient save / load and view local directory
    o  Web assembly
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  update readme
    o  design docco
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
        o  include tinternet examples?
