    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    *  Do lifeline lines
    *  change lifelineTitleBox to use tidemark as top, having advanced 
    *  experiment also with centre justifying interaction line labels
    *  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    *  allboxstates is horrid name
    *  newAllBoxStates got left behind in renaming
    *  Should private types be lower case? bit of muddle
    *  How stimulate go lint and go vet from command line
    *  more module level comments
    *  any potential for make diag package smaller? (no)

    o  add a rectangular border with letter markers in view also
        *  analysis
            *  plain rect border with tlh corner containing title
               label in enclosed box
            *  dsl?
                *  title foo | bar
        *  branch title
        *  parser system
        *  render and layout
            *  design algo
        o  do
            o  frameMaker.produceFrameAndTitleBox
            o  frameMaker.finalizeFrame
        o  merge title box branch into main
    o  show lane letters - possibly optionally
    o  consider if image regression tests needed - or maybe only canonical?
    o  what happens if you introduce a lifeline late in the script?
    o  what happens if you put title in too late?
    o  many lifelines example suggests self labels might be better off
       going back above the loop and being allowed to go further right
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  Lifeline should be different mark space than response line
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  update readme
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algo for title box
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Treat as one thing
o  Dedicated module
o  Diag borders remain outermost
o  Will need to inform lifeline pitch and spacing - reduced margins
o  title frame will need to claim space for itself and render itself
o  the rest has to be produced in register/finalize way
o  handling of final advance of tidemark will have to be moved from
   finalize lifelines to this
