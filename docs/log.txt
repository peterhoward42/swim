*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Find visualisation pathway
    *  rename package umli?

    o  export be separate repo
        *  do it
        *  port umli to consume other 
        *  add proper doc/readme incl x ref
        *  change graphics model contract to having want arrow param when
           adding line, but no field in line struct, and *anticipate* list of
           arrowheads in prims
        o  fatten out export for arrows
            *  upgrade model to have arrow heads in
            *  upgrade image create to do something with arrows
            o  implement rendering of arrows in image creator
                o  code
                    *  make gg context a create object state
                    *  split create into bg, lines, arrows fn etc
                    *  redo graphics model to have polygons not arrowheads
                       or has arrow on lines!
                    o  render and test arrows
                o  visual test
        o  fatten out export for multiline labels with justifications
        o  repair regression test for image create and maybe diag create?

    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        *  Title Boxes
        o  Title Box Text
            o  Consider what utils need confidence in first
                o  export.PNG() should be generic .png, jpg, and .gif
                   or error otherwise
                o  are visual tests conventient?
                o  upgrade export.PNG and its tests to include justified
                   text labels
            o  Expand out Create() case for title box labels, and tests
    o  Have two spelling for lable/label
    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
