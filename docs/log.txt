    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    *  Do lifeline lines
    *  change lifelineTitleBox to use tidemark as top, having advanced 
    o  experiment also with centre justifying interaction line labels
        o  will make lifeline breaks look more obviously needed
    o  add a rectangular border with letter markers in view also
    o  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    o  newAllBoxStates got left behind in renaming
    o  show lane letters - possibly optionally
    o  consider if image regression tests needed - or maybe only canonical?
    o  what happens if you introduce a lifeline late in the script?
    o  many lifelines example suggests self labels might be better off
       going back above the loop and being allowed to go further right
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  Render lifline label letters
    o  Should private types be lower case? bit of muddle
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
