    *  Activity boxes
    o  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    o  Try out pushing self label inside its box
    o  Lane lines
        o  Rename to lifelines first
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be edit me
    o  Change terminology
        o  Lane -> lifeline
        o  TitleBox -> lifelineheader
    o  Should private types be lower case?
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  may need to rebrand as uml sequence diagram
    o  cf creately differentiate

Actitity Boxes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Scanning state has box in progress boolean (inbox)
o  Triggers to start a box:
    o  When an interaction or self loop originates from X, and X is not
       inbox, then start X box before the interaction line.
    o  When an interaction or self loop arrives at X, and X is not
       inbox, then start X box level with the interaction line.
o  Triggers to finish a box:
    o  Explicit stop
    o  End of diagram
o  Need state for inbox for each lane 
    o  Init before first pass create
    o  Preserved through to later passes to close off any remianing open
    o  Must also track Y coords at which each in box started to support
       drawing box sides at end
