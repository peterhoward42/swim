Algo
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

assume some global sizing ratio constants wrt char height: sizing.ratios

init some sizing
    horiz: sizing.Horiz
        lane x
        lane header box width
        box widths
        self loop width
        char width
    vert lane sizing.vert
        lane header box depth
        padding unit
        char height
        self loop height

every statement has graphical mandate: diag.events.LaneHeader etc.

define graphical events like this:
    draw laneheader boxes
    draw label segments
    draw lane timeline
    draw self loop
    start a box
    finish a box
    draw a full or dash line

iterate over all statements diag.Schema
    capture graphical obligation
    capture incremental v headroom consumed sizing.vert.Claims

add similary - finishing up obligations
    for example
        terminating boxes
        interrupting lane time lines to prevent clash with full/dash or
                label

// now we have the scan oriented info we need to build graphics model

have a rendering phase in which the graphical model is built: diag.GraphicsFactory
    iterate through graphical events model
    advance vertical offset according to the claim associated with the
        graphical obligation
    delegate augmenting graphics model to type specific helpers - injecting
        the vertical offset

type specific helpers 
    explode graphical implications into graphics model primitives
    including sizing policy for that type
