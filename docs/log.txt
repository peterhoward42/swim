    o  improve uxp / behaviour w.r.t. text size
        *  analysis
        *  decision log
        *  finalize dsl
        *  dedicated branch: textsize
        o  step one privatise the diag with 
            *  change type of width to float64,
            *  remove it from constructor and set it to a package constant
            *  change argument of constructor to take text size ratio argument,
               and set fontHeight attribute accordingly
            *  remove unneccessary casts
        o  min viable image file render solution
        o  add dsl control and tests
        o  upgrade image file renderer to scale
        o  explore quality attainable
        o  make sure properly tested
        o  merge to master

    o  document the diagram creation algorithm
    o  make title compulsory
    o  careful think tests
    o  show lane letters - possibly optionally
    o  consider if image regression tests needed - or maybe only canonical?
    o  what happens if you introduce a lifeline late in the script?
    o  what happens if you put title in too late?
    o  question merit of sizer unit test given visual test efficiency
    o  many lifelines example suggests self labels might be better off
       going back above the loop and being allowed to go further right
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  virgin clone of umli fails create tests because no directory
       to save in - fix when decide on visual image difference testing
    o  Lifeline should be different mark space than response line
    o  Convenient save / load and view local directory
    o  Web assembly
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  update readme
    o  design docco
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
        o  include tinternet examples?
