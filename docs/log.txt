*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Write a skeleton test for the Creator to drive out
       recursive tdd of what is left in the diag package
    o  tdd Creator
        *  DI width and height
        *  Skeleton code in Create() to tease out APIs for collaborating
           types.
        *  DrawingEventContext
        o  All code required  to make Draw lane header box work
            *  LaneHorizInfo as first class separate class / module
            *  LaneHorizInfo test
            *  Sizer type - containing a Lanes, and used by creator
                *  sizer needs title box top margin
                *  graphicsprim needs add line
                *  graphicsprim needs add rect
                *  add tests for graphics behaviour
                    *  separate model from prims
                *  switch graphics coords to being float64 and explain
                *  serialize tests fix up
            o  Back to creator using the new features?
                *  sizer needs test that composes itself right
                *  is lanes sizer using sizer top margin
                o  How isolate to make create tests more amenable?
                    o  creator's laneTitleBox function 
                        o  make new margin a returned value
                            o  do it
                            o  regression
                        o  use mock for these?
                            o  assembles correct properties from a sizer to
                               define a rect
                            o  does make a rect
                            o  advances margin the right amount
            o  Tests for everything done so far
    o  Ready for something end to end to begin visualiszation?
    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
