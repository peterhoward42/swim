*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Find visualisation pathway
    *  rename package umli?
    *  export be separate repo
    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        *  Title Boxes
        *  Title Box Text
        *  Full / Dash labels
        *  Full / Dash lines
        *  Replace literal graphics.Point with NewPoint
        *  tune dash line settings
        *  ditch duplication in settings and sizer
        *  patch up sizer tests
        *  rename sizers package as sizer
        *  augment creator tests? necessary yet
            *  quantitative equiv of interaction line visuals
            *  another (before) for arrow head at correct end
        o  separate polygon in graphics, and then put in test for hasExactly blah
        o  Self interactions
        o  Activity boxes
        o  Lane lines
        o  Diagram height setting
        o  augment creator tests? necessary yet

    o  todo resurrect regressions tests for images

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            o  write down srp for sizer and settings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  sizer package single source of truth to diag creator for
   sizes, dimensions, spacing, margins etc.
   implements policy for sizing decisions
o  the idea being to completely separate the respon for alg interp of 
   diag generation (diag) and sizing decisions
o  inverse for diag
