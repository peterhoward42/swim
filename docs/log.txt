    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    *  Do lifeline lines
    o  remove images for now from repo
    o  change lifelineTitleBox to use tidemark as top, having advanced 
       tidemark to diagpadtop before hand,
    o  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    o  newAllBoxStates got left behind in renaming
    o  show lane letters - possibly optionally
    o  many lifelines example suggests self labels might be better off
       going back above the loop and being allowed to go further right
    o  experiment also with centre justifying interaction line labels
        o  will make lifeline breaks look more obviously needed
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  Render lifline label letters
    o  Should private types be lower case? bit of muddle
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intent for interactionline claims?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  When an interaction crosses a lane...
    o  claim top is... a little above the highest label top
    o  claim bottom is... a little below the interacation line
o  Uniform regardless of h-justification?
    o  yes to start with
o  What about self loops?
    o  Not required - will never cross other lanes, and text is inside
       the loop
