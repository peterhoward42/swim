o  sizer
	*  put in Makefile lifecycle

       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
		o  Make it like this: https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0f233672bb8653cf58fe80f4e414e6d48609265c/9a97d/assets-jekyll/blog/client-creds-with-spring-boot/password-sequence-425e0b5f98c58bdf5b977262eaa422c275c63ec3b2d4c4c670fd866d90c0f69b.png

		o  Merge to main
	o  some kind of end to end test or cmd?
	o  update to later go and newest dependencies
	o  Add scaling helpers to graphics model and integration test
	o  Am I happy with the title visuals?

	o  design docco, package docco  and readme needs reflecting

    o  benchmarks and tuning
