*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Find visualisation pathway
    *  rename package umli?
    *  export be separate repo
    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        *  Title Boxes
        *  Title Box Text
        *  Full / Dash labels
        *  Full / Dash lines
        *  Replace literal graphics.Point with NewPoint
        o  tune dash line settings
            *  remove renderer knowledge of dash sizing and put alt
               functionality into the graphics model and fix up umli and umlie.
                *  decide what to offer in graphics model
                    *  dash and gap lengths
                *  make settings
                *  make attributes
                *  init in graphics model based on diagram and font size
                *  test for settings in sizer
                *  test for correct passing in to creator
            *  remove knowledge from renderer
            *  patch up
            *  tune setting
            *  if sizer in export now redundant - get rid of it
            o  commit
        o  ditch duplication in settings and sizer
            o  what is actually worth putting in sizer?
        o  patch up sizer tests
        o  augment creator tests?
        o  Self interactions
        o  Activity boxes
        o  Lane lines
        o  Diagram height setting

    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
    o  todo resurrect regressions tests for images

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full lines labels
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  hjust centre on inter-lane mid
o  each line vjust top
o  first line Y is tide mark
o  second and subsequent one text height further down
o  at end tide mark advance to bottom of text plus dedicated padding setting
