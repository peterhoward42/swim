*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    o  Find visualisation pathway
        *  Think about repo split and document
        *  Design mvp CLI
        o  .png exporter
            *  choose lib = fogleman/gg
            o  tdd
                *  test that file creation err msg
                *  test that file produced
                o  test file indentical with established reference, with
                   one of each thing in
                    *  graphicsModel needs height attrib
                    *  tdd to cf an established reference file with real
                       cf commented out
                    *  use this to check the image visually
                    *  now stash this file as the reference
                    o  put in an image equality test using imgeq, that
                       also makes it easy to view the generated file
                    o  hack capture the golden reference, inspet and
                       store it
                    o  revert to proper test - should say ok

    o  rename package umli?

    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        o  Need title box size and position check
    o  Have two spelling for lable/label
    o  Move all sizing constants into a module
    o  Ready for something end to end to begin visualiszation?
    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
