    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    o  Do lifeline lines
        *  Design algorithm
        *  Initiate a sub package under diag - lifeline
        o  tdd from creator according to design below
            *  timeout improve name for allBoxStates - vars and types
        o  start again - there is a simpler design
            *  exo skel
            *  get to compile by commenting out - leaving list of debt
               here
              *  provision of TitleBoxBottom in sizer.Lifelines and use by
                 creation of titleboxes so single source of truth
                      *  add sizer test
              *  stop testresults/new being committed
              *  sortGaps and mergeGaps test
              o  call to activityBoxExtents() from lifeline.go
                o  how / who track and store?
                    o  can box states be upgraded to do this? (Preferably 
                       without changing API.)
              o  call to interactionLineSpaceClaims from lifeline.go
            o  work through debt with tests bottom up
            o  may need to merge gaps before sort?
            o  optimise out silly small bits
            o  end of lifelines not quite right wrt end of boxes
    o  change lifelineTitleBox to use tidemark as top, having advanced 
       tidemark to diagpadtop before hand,
    o  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    o  newAllBoxStates got left behind in renaming
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  Render lifline label letters
    o  Should private types be lower case?
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lifeline lines algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Start with line from bottom of title box to a bit below tidemark
   made by call to finalize boxes
o  Add own padB
o  Init pool of segment = single line
o  chop out sections where activity boxes live - splintering pool
o  chop out sections for where interaction lines and labels cross that lane
o  jettison very short remnants
o  that's it
