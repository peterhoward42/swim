o  line ds comprises
    o  orgin text, orig line number
    o  kw
    o  lane operands list of 1 or 2 cap letters
    o  msglines (list of strings, one for each line)

o  parse as follows
    o  capture kw and lane operands in one go with tight regex
    o  capture rest with catchall
    o  process rest by
        o  trim
        o  split on pie
        o  trim components

o  post parse validation
    o  capture lane strings in order - ensuring single cap letter
    o  insist lane operands exist as lanes
    o  insist full and dash have two lane operands
    o  insiste that all types except stop has some non empty msglines
