o  sizer
	*  now look again at creator itself for more stripping out
	o  get rid of hidden creator and tests
	o  see if can get all tests to pass?
	o  commit as sizer change
	o  merge to main
	o  new branch
	o  rename activyBoxes?
	o  Segment should have constructor to avoid so many warnings about it
	   using unkeyed fields, so should Point, Line, Prims
	o  Capitulate 100 char lines and lint enforce, improve

	o  wean off reference input?

	o  box state looks like it can be simplified, and could do with a test
	o  Add explicit arrows choice to graphics model?
	o  Add scaling helpers to graphics model
	o  arrow could go into something like a plain geom package
	o  design docco, package docco  and readme needs reflecting
               
    o  consider if image regression tests needed - or maybe only canonical?
    o  what happens if you introduce a lifeline late in the script?
    o  what happens if you put title in too late?
    o  question merit of sizer unit test given visual test efficiency
    o  tune settings
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  virgin clone of umli fails create tests because no directory
       to save in - fix when decide on visual image difference testing
	  	o  make similar to stdalone gui would be good to include linting
    o  Lifeline should be different mark space than response line
    o  Web assembly
    o  cli
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  ci/cd
        o  circle?
        o  go releases?
    o  resolution and crispness
    o  consumption in the anticipated forms
    o  update readme
    o  design docco
    o  godoc example
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
        o  include tinternet examples?
