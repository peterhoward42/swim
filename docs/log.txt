    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    o  Lane lines -> lifelines
        *  Keyword
            *  Change in kewords and ref diag and fix up so
               everything compiles and tests pass
        *  Plural type
        *  Singular type
        *  What other types?
        *  pick through ag plural
        *  pick through ag singular
        o  Reformat
            o  go fmt with overwrite on entire code base?
            o  what was blacken?
            o  linelength folder tool?
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be edit me
    o  Change terminology
        o  Lane -> lifeline
        o  TitleBox -> lifelineheader
    o  Should private types be lower case?
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately differentiate
