*  Do the geometry model and test it is good for json or yaml serialisation
*  Refactor parser and improve tests
*  Psuedo code diagram builder
*  Tease out CRC and cf original plans
*  Challenge tests so far wrt recent test guidance
    *  Find visualisation pathway
    *  rename package umli?

    o  export be separate repo
        *  do it
        *  port umli to consume other 
        *  add proper doc/readme incl x ref
        o  change graphics model contract to having want arrow param when
           adding line, but no field in line struct, and *anticipate* list of
           arrowheads in prims
            *  fix up regression both repos and checkin
            *  now populate arrow heads when add lines
            *  programmatic test for that and commit
                *  arrow head make test to correct angles
                *  add line with arrow generates arrow
        o  fatten out export for dashed lines
            *  make image export test include arrows and dashes,
               with visual tests
            o  bring up exporter to satisfy visual
                *  first make Create stateful and checkin
                *  now give Create a sizer init with model w/h
                *  does fogleman/gg support dashed types? = yes
                *  have a rendersizing object initialized with model width and font size
                *  derive mark space from measure of smallness inside rendersizing model
        o  fatten out export for arrows
        o  fatten out export for multiline labels with justifications
        o  repair regression test

    o  Go back to diag.Create() tdd
        *  Title Boxes
        o  Title Box Text
            o  Consider what utils need confidence in first
                o  export.PNG() should be generic .png, jpg, and .gif
                   or error otherwise
                o  are visual tests conventient?
                o  upgrade export.PNG and its tests to include justified
                   text labels
            o  Expand out Create() case for title box labels, and tests
    o  Have two spelling for lable/label
    o  Now other event types in creator
    o  How test the modules are mainly just data?
