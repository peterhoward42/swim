    *  Activity boxes
    *  Why creator referring to left and right things?
    *  Try out left or right justifying labels near their arrow,
    *  Anything that can make creator module smaller?
    *  Lane lines -> lifelines
    o  Do lifeline lines
        *  Design algorithm
        *  Initiate a sub package under diag - lifeline
        o  tdd from creator according to design below
            o  timeout improve name for allBoxStates - vars and types
        o  Introduce lifeline line pruner
            o  Track box territories in it
            o  Track interaction line territories in it
                o  defer api until needs clear from later
        o  Introduce and test a chopper
        o  Ditch lifeline line event
        o  Introduce method in creator after finalize activity boxes
            o  Delegate everything to a dedicated type/module
        o  start global segment pool
        o  Iterate over each lane in that method
            o  start a pool of just full length line y coords
            o  iterate over all activity box segs for that lane
                o  chop y coords with chopper
            o  iterate over interaction line space claims only for
               lines going from immediate neighbours either side
                fart.... only neighbours
                o  iterate over tracked interaction space claims for that lane
                o  chop y coords with same chopper
            o  add prims for non silly segments
    o  sizer.Lanes (and test) modules got left behing in rename
    o  Might be best to hard code and hide the size  - and
       encourage client to scale in context, or to make images big and
       then use image lib to scale to suit?
        o  if so, then make sure no pointless tests
    o  Change reference model to make label not too long, and maybe
       be more computer sciency - plus update readme to suit
    o  Add title keyword which could be "edit me"
    o  Render lifline label letters
    o  Should private types be lower case?
    o  Lifeline should be coarser mark space than response line
    o  Todo resurrect regressions tests for images
    o  benchmarks and tuning
    o  godoc example
    o  may need to rebrand as uml **sequence** diagram
    o  cf creately and sequencediag.com differentiate


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lifeline lines algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
o  Start with line from bottom of title box to a bit below tidemark
   made by call to finalize boxes
o  Add own padB
o  Init pool of segment = single line
o  chop out sections where activity boxes live - splintering pool
o  chop out sections for where interaction lines and labels cross that lane
o  jettison very short remnants
o  that's it
